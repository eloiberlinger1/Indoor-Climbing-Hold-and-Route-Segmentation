1. put all images together
-> Dosen't matter in wich gym the image was taken.
-> We can store this info in the annotation file
-> The images need to have same dimensions

2. Resize all the images to one single dimension
Change format to PNG (this can be changed if there is really a lot of images in the future)

Adapt coord of the annotations.
