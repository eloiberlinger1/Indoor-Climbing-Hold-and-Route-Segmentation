# Indoor Climbing Hold and Route Segmentation
This repository contains the source code for the technical report [Indoor Climbing Hold and Route Segmentation](TODO), made as a final project for the [Computer Vision: 3D Reconstruction](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/content/computer-vision-3d-reconstruction-ws-2223) course (University of Heidelberg).

## Obtaining data
The data used can be obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomasslama/indoor-climbing-gym-hold-segmentation

## Running the code
A short demo of the implemented functionality can be found in `demo.ipynb`.
